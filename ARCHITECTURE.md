# Architecture

## Overview

Sonar Lark is a drone racing simulator with a built-in map editor. Users define obstacle types (importing 3D models from Blender), build race courses by placing obstacles, then simulate 12 AI drones racing through the course.

## Data Flow

### Obstacle Pipeline
```
Blender ──► obstacles.glb ──► Obstacle Workshop ──► default.obstacles.ron
                                                           │
                                                    ObstacleLibrary (Resource)
```

Each obstacle definition maps a human-readable ID to a named node (Blender object) inside the glb, plus an optional trigger volume configuration.

### Course Pipeline
```
ObstacleLibrary + Course Editor ──► *.course.ron
                                          │
                                    CourseData (Resource)
                                          │
                                    spawn_course() ──► Obstacle entities + TriggerVolume children
```

A course file stores obstacle references (by ObstacleId) with per-instance transforms and gate ordering. It does not duplicate obstacle definitions.

### Race Pipeline
```
CourseData ──► spawn obstacles + drones
                      │
              FixedUpdate: AI targets → PID → forces → integration
                      │
              Update (chained): tick_countdown → tick_race_clock
                  → gate_trigger_check → miss_detection → check_race_finished
                      │
              All finished/crashed → RacePhase::Finished
```

## Performance Design

- All drone physics in `FixedUpdate` (64Hz default), `.chain()`-ed for correctness
- Gate trigger checks: O(drones × gates) = O(12 × ~20) = O(240) AABB tests per frame
- AI spline sampling: O(12) per fixed tick (polynomial eval per drone, 5 curvature samples for speed limiting)
- Dirty air perturbation: O(12²) = O(144) distance/dot-product checks per fixed tick (negligible)
- Proximity avoidance: O(12²) = O(144) distance checks per fixed tick (negligible)
- No system ordering constraints between unrelated plugins — maximum parallelism
- `DespawnOnExit` for automatic entity cleanup on state transitions

                                                    AI targets (spline projection) → racing line (spline sampling)

                                                    → apply_forces → integration → clamp

                                                    Post-race: Racing → Returning (per-drone)
                                                    → generate_return_path() → non-cyclic spline
                                                    → smoothstep deceleration → return to start
                                                    → Returning → Idle (hover)
```

The physics model uses a **thrust-through-body** architecture: the drone's orientation determines its thrust direction (always body-up). A cascaded controller (outer position PID → inner attitude PD) drives orientation, and motor lag filters thrust changes. Quadratic drag and angular dynamics with moment of inertia produce realistic banking, braking, and hover behavior. Aerodynamic perturbations (dirty air from leading drones, prop wash on descent) add angular wobble that the PD must fight, producing visible instability in dirty air. Battery sag linearly reduces max thrust over the race duration.

Drone spawning uses an async polling pattern: `setup_drone_assets` and `spawn_drones` run every `Update` frame, returning early until the glTF asset and `CourseData` are both available. Once drones spawn, the early-return guards make them no-ops.

## Testing

Unit tests cover the pure-logic data layers. Run with `cargo test`.

| Module | Tests | What's covered |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| `obstacle::library` | 8 | Insert/get, overwrite, save/load roundtrip, error cases, existing RON format |
| `course::loader` | 9 | Save/load roundtrip, empty course, transform preservation, error cases, existing RON format, delete course |
| `menu::ui` | 5 | Course discovery, filtering, sorting, path storage, missing directory |
| `camera::orbit` | 3 | Orbit distance, transform computation, look-at verification |
| `drone::spawning` | 19 | Race path/spline generation (sort, filter, empty, single gate, passes-through-gates, tangent nonzero, adaptive approach offset), per-drone path generation (paths differ, passes near gates, tangent alignment, neutral matches base), start positions (count, behind gate, no overlap), config randomization bounds (incl. cornering/braking/attitude/racing-line variation), PID variation, return path generation (valid spline, per-drone variation) |
| `race::progress` | 15 | Gate pass advancement, crash/finish recording, idempotency, is_active, standings sorting (finished by time, finished before crashed, crashed by gates passed) |
| `race::gate` | 8 | Point-in-trigger-volume AABB: identity, translated, rotated, scaled transforms (inside + outside) |
| `rendering::cel_material` | 3 | Hue-shift algorithm: highlight warmth, shadow coolness, color clamping |

Functions used by tests:
- `ObstacleLibrary::load_from_file` / `save_to_file` — pure file I/O, no Bevy systems
- `load_course_from_file` / `save_course` / `delete_course` — pure file I/O, no Bevy systems
- `discover_courses_in(path)` — parameterized version of `discover_courses()` for testability
- `generate_race_path(course)` / `generate_drone_race_path(course, config, index)` / `compute_start_positions(...)` / `generate_return_path(...)` — pure geometry, no ECS
